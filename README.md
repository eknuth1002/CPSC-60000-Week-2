# CPSC-60000-Week-2

This is my Week 2 project. It is based around a pottery factory ordering system and includes the price per pound of clay, the price for underglaze and/or overglaze for decorations, and the price of overglaze for the entire piece.

This project uses the Factory pattern to decouple the creation of items to allow modifications of a base style.  These modification are regionally based in designs and colors common to pottery in that area.  Each Factory can create objects based on those requirements.
